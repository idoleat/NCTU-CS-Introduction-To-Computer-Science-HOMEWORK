1.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then prints the number with 
its digits reversed. A session with the program should have the following appearance:
Enter a two-digit number: 28
The reversal is: 82 

(Read the number using %d, then break it into two digits. Hint:If n is an integer. then n%10 
is the last digit in n and n/10 is n with the last digit removed.)

 
2. 
Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays it in octal (base 8):
Enter a number between O and 32767: 1953
In octal, your number is: 03641
The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits are sufficient. Hint: To convert the number to octal, first divide it by 8; the remainder is the last digit of the octal number (1, in this case). Then divide the original number by 8 and repeat the process to arrive at the next-to-last digit. (printf is capable of displaying numbers in base 8, as we'll see in Chapter 7, so there's actually an easier way to write this program.)
