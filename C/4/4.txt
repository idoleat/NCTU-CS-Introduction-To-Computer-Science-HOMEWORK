Modify the poker. c program of Section 10.5 by having it recognize an additional category, "royal flush'" (ace, king. queen. jack, ten of the same suit). A royal flush ranks higher than all other hands.

Write a program that prompts the user for a number and then displays the number, using characters to simulate the effect of a seven-segment display:
Enter a number: 491-9014
        _           _     _              
| _ | | _ |     | | _ | |   |     | | _ |
    |   _ |     |   _ | | _ |     |     |

Characters other than digits should be ignored. Write the program so that the maximum number of digits is controlled by a macro named MAX_DIGITS, which has the value 10. If    the number contains more than this number of digits, the extra digits are ignored. Hints: Use two external arrays. One is the segments array (see Exercise 6 in Chapter 8), which stores data representing the correspondence between digits and segment. The other array, digits, will be an array of characters with 4 rows (since each segmented digit is four characters high) and MAX DIGITS * 4 columns (digits are three characters wide. but a space is needed between digits for readability). Write your program as four functions: main, clear_digits_array, process_digit, and print_digits_array. Here are the prototypes for the latter three functions:
void clear_digits_array(void);
void process_digit(int digit, int position);
void print_digits_array(void);

clear_digits_array will store blank characters into all elements of the digits array. process_digit will store the seven-segment representation of digit into a specified position in the digits array (positions range from 0 to MAX_DIGITS - 1). print_digits_array will display the rows of tile digits array, each on a single line, producing output such as that shown in the example.
